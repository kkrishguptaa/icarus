## Inspiration

The Fall of Icarus is a classic greek tale of tragedy and sacrifice. Icarus is given wings, but if he shall fly two low, they'll get soaked from the water sprays and become incapable of flight, if he shall fly too high, the sun will melt the wax that held together the wings and he shall fall down. Icarus soars up above near the sun and has his wings melt, and drowns in an ocean after. This game's protagonist is Icarus and sacrifices.

## Concept

Every few levels, you are given choice to sacrifice amongst one of your abilities. Some levels let you gain back abilities. However, to go through you must sacrifice. **Sacrifices must be made** to reach the end.

Obstacles: Spikes, Fireball, Moving Minotaur (enemy)
Abilities: Flight, Vision, Shoot, Dash, Movement

### AI Usage

- Refactoring
- Scaffolding/Boilerplate — HOLY DOES PHASERJS NEED BOILERPLATE. It was mostly copy pasting and renaming but I made GPT do it ✨
- Levels: I wrote a couple levels and then let copilot wreak havoc and make more, but it made crappy levels with weird proportions so I had to change almost everything again anyway, but it did scaffold
